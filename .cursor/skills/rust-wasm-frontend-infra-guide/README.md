**Rust-Wasm Frontend Infrastructure Vertical Deepening Architectural Specification** — Hard constraints for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target compilation configuration, cross-language boundary, linear memory management, concurrency model, and general code adaptation.

---

## Overview

This specification inherits the core philosophy from [`rust-architecture-guide`](../rust-architecture-guide/), deepening vertically for the uniqueness of the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target (linear memory, single-threaded event loop, cross-language boundary).

This Skill is the compilation & boundary layer foundation for all Rust+Wasm frontend architectures (including no-DOM rendering engines) and must be inherited and obeyed.

**Environment Assumptions**: Wasm linear memory only grows, JS to Wasm boundary is expensive RPC, browser main thread must not be blocked, zero-copy views are unsafe operations.

## Core Philosophy

This specification is the engineering implementation of the "Dialectical Materialism and Jeet Kune Do" architectural philosophy at the compilation and boundary layer.

- **Wasm linear memory only grows**, must be reclaimed internally.
- **JS to Wasm boundary is an expensive RPC**, any implicit conversion is a performance liability.
- **Browser is a sandboxed OS**, event loop, multi-threading limits, and security policies are physical laws that must be complied with.

From these, four iron rules are derived:

| ID | Iron Rule | Meaning |
|----|-----------|---------|
| **IRON-01** | Binary Size Is Paramount | Compilation artifacts must be aggressively compressed, all debug info, unwind tables, and redundant sections stripped |
| **IRON-02** | Zero-Copy at Boundary | On high-frequency data paths, always pass pointer+length, never serialize; zero-copy view lifetimes must be documented |
| **IRON-03** | Memory Partitioning | Global state static residency, per-frame objects ephemeral, prevent dynamic allocation fragmentation |
| **IRON-04** | Cross-Origin Isolation Documented | Any use of `SharedArrayBuffer` must document COOP/COEP header configuration requirements |

- This guide depends on `rust-architecture-guide`'s P0-P3 priority framework and execution modes
- This guide adds compilation & boundary layer red lines for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` scenarios on top of P0 safety
- **Complementary use**: The universal constitution provides the priority framework; this guide is the Wasm vertical deepening amendment
