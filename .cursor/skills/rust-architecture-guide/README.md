# Rust Architecture Guide

**Universal Rust Engineering Decision Constitution** — Covering architecture design, idiomatic coding style, metaprogramming, FFI interop, performance tuning, and advanced quality assurance for all Rust projects.

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

## Overview

This guide is the **constitutional foundation** for AI coding assistants, providing:

- **Four-level priority system** (P0 Safety → P1 Maintainability → P2 Compile Time → P3 Performance)
- **Three execution modes** (rapid / standard / strict)
- **Type-driven architecture** (state machines, Newtype, zero-cost abstraction boundaries)
- **Ownership layering strategy** (business layer Owned, hotpath layer zero-copy)
- **Error handling layering** (library-level `thiserror`, application-level `anyhow`)
- **Jeet Kune Do coding style** (Intercepting Boilerplate, Economy of Motion, Hardware Sympathy)
- **Agent self-check list** + Decision Summary output contract

## Core Philosophy

> **Pursue excellence at system boundaries and hot paths; release mental load for internal flows and cold paths.**

### Priority Pyramid

| Priority | Focus | Rule |
|----------|-------|------|
| **P0** | Safety & Correctness | Memory safety, data consistency — non-negotiable |
| **P1** | Maintainability | Readability, local complexity control — default pursuit |
| **P2** | Compile Time | Build speed, CI/CD efficiency — measure then decide |
| **P3** | Runtime Performance | Only for proven bottlenecks — requires Profiler evidence |

### Dialectical Materialism

Engineering decisions are resolved through contradiction:
- **Unity of Opposites**: `unsafe` and safe are not enemies — `unsafe` is the material foundation of safe abstractions
- **Quantitative to Qualitative Change**: MVP `Option<bool>` flags accumulate, then must undergo qualitative change into Enum state machines
- **Negation of Negation**: Errors are not endpoints — panic → catch → graceful degradation, each negation reaches higher resilience

### Jeet Kune Do Coding Philosophy

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Intercepting Boilerplate** | If logic can be expressed in 1 line of pattern matching, never use 5 lines of nesting |
| **Economy of Motion** | Every line of code should point directly to intent. Eliminate redundant intermediate variables and implicit copies |
| **Hardware Sympathy** | Leverage iterators and zero-copy types, align with the compiler's inline optimization |

### Execution Modes

| Mode | Enforce | Trade-off |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `rapid` | P0 only | Unlimited `.clone()`, `anyhow` in libraries, no doc-tests |
| `standard` | P0 + P1 | Default for most projects |
| `strict` | P0–P3 | All deviations require formal `// DEVIATION:` annotation |
