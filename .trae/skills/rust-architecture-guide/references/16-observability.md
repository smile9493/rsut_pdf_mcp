# Rust Observability & Production Diagnostics

This specification covers the core areas of **Operations (Ops) and Observability** in system architecture.

In Rust's async world, traditional monitoring approaches encounter dimensionality reduction: A network request may bounce between dozens of different threads, and traditional thread-based logging cannot trace context. Moreover, since Rust pursues extreme performance, introducing high-overhead monitoring probes in hot code is like pouring sand into a sports car engine.

To complete this "world-class architect" puzzle, we penetrate deep into specific engineering implementation details, code patterns, and architectural trade-offs.

---

## 1. Abandon Flat Logging, Embrace Structured Tracing (`tracing` Ecosystem)

**Pain Point Analysis**: In `tokio`-style work-stealing async runtimes, a user's request processing (Future) may execute step one on CPU-0 thread, and step two (after `.await` wake-up) on CPU-3 thread. If you use traditional `log::info!`, logs scatter across different thread streams, impossible to piece together a complete request trace.

### Deep Specifications and Implementation:

#### 1. Mandatory Span Isolation Mechanism

**Rule**: Don't just print discrete events. Create a time-spanning `Span` for every logical request (HTTP Request, Kafka message consumption).

**Implementation**: Use `tracing::Instrument` trait or `#[tracing::instrument]` macro.

**Code Patterns**:
```rust
// ❌ Amateur approach: No context
async fn process_order(order_id: u64) {
    log::info!("Starting order processing {}", order_id);
    // ... await operations
    log::info!("Order {} processing complete", order_id); // May be separated by thousands of other request logs
}

// ✅ Architect approach: Automatic Span context injection
// err attribute auto-logs Result::Err as ERROR level
// skip shields huge fields (like db connection pool) from serialization
#[tracing::instrument(name = "order_workflow", skip(db_pool), err)]
async fn process_order(order_id: u64, db_pool: &DbPool) -> Result<(), Error> {
    tracing::info!("Entering order processing workflow"); // This log automatically carries order_id=xxx tag
    // ... All internal await calls, their logs belong under this Span
    Ok(())
}
```

#### 2. Full-link Context Propagation (Distributed Context Propagation)

**Rule**: In microservices architecture, requests cross processes. **Must** comply with W3C Trace Context standard.

**Implementation**: Generate unified `Trace-Id` at gateway layer. When calling external HTTP services or RPC, use `HeaderInjector` from `tracing-opentelemetry` to forcefully inject current Trace Context into HTTP Headers or gRPC Metadata, achieving cross-machine tracing.

#### 3. Async Log Output Non-Blocking Mechanism

**Rule**: **Absolutely prohibit** direct disk I/O (file writing) or network I/O (sending logs to ELK) in business threads.

**Implementation**: Must use `tracing_appender::non_blocking`. It establishes a lock-free queue in memory, with an extremely lightweight background dedicated thread responsible for flushing logs to disk or network, ensuring disk I/O jitter never blocks Tokio's business computation threads.

---

## 2. Zero-Cost Metrics Collection

**Pain Point Analysis**: Metrics (QPS, P99 latency, error rate) need extremely high-frequency updates. If you grab a Mutex lock on every metrics update, system performance immediately collapses.

### Deep Specifications and Implementation:

#### 1. Extreme Low-Level Atomic Accumulation

**Rule**: Metrics data collection on hot paths must degrade to CPU-level atomic operations (`AtomicU64` / `AtomicI64`) with weakest memory barrier `Ordering::Relaxed`.

**Implementation**: Use officially recommended `metrics` facade library or `prometheus` library.

**Code Patterns**:
```rust
// In extremely high-frequency network packet parsing layer
pub fn parse_packet(data: &[u8]) {
    // This line is only one assembly atomic add instruction, < 1 nanosecond
    metrics::counter!("tcp_packets_parsed", "protocol" => "http").increment(1);
    
    let start = std::time::Instant::now();
    // ... Execute business logic ...
    // Record Histogram for P99 latency distribution
    metrics::histogram!("packet_process_latency").record(start.elapsed().as_secs_f64());
}
```

#### 2. Push vs Pull Architecture Decision

**Architecture Rule**: For server-side long-running programs, **always prioritize Pull model**.

**Implementation**: Don't let your business program actively connect to monitoring center to send data (if monitoring center crashes, your program may be affected). Correct approach: Start an independent Tokio Task inside the program, listening on a bypass port (e.g., `0.0.0.0:9090/metrics`), letting Prometheus server actively pull memory atom snapshots every 15 seconds.

**Resource Isolation**: This metrics endpoint must be physically isolated from core business interface. Even when business thread pool is saturated, bypass monitoring port still responds normally.

---

## 3. Panic Defense and Core Dumps

**Pain Point Analysis**: Rust's `panic!` default behavior is stack unwinding. In multi-threaded/async scenarios, if a Tokio Task panics, it usually **only kills that one Task**, while main process survives. This is extremely dangerous architecturally: The Task may hold a global resource lock before dying, or leave half-initialized dirty data. This "half-dead zombie" state is harder to debug than outright crash.

### Deep Specifications and Implementation:

#### 1. Fail-Fast and Process Suicide

**Rule**: For stateless microservice nodes, **not recommended** to catch and recover panics at top level (unless for single stateless HTTP request middleware-level isolation). Global Panic means undefined or unexpected logic flaws exist.

**Architecture Decision**: Once Panic occurs, immediately and cleanly kill the node. Hand restart and traffic transfer to Kubernetes and other orchestration systems.

#### 2. Custom Fallback Hook (The Ultimate Panic Hook)

**Rule**: Must override default Panic behavior on the first line of `main.rs`, ensuring complete "last testament" before death.

**Implementation Code**:
```rust
pub fn setup_global_panic_hook() {
    std::panic::set_hook(Box::new(|panic_info| {
        // 1. Get complete error location and payload
        let payload = panic_info.payload().downcast_ref::<&str>().unwrap_or(&"Unknown Panic");
        let location = panic_info.location().unwrap();
        
        // 2. Capture current call stack (Backtrace)
        let backtrace = std::backtrace::Backtrace::force_capture();
        
        // 3. Write to system logs synchronously (bypass async queue, direct file or stderr)
        eprintln!("CRITICAL FATAL ERROR: at {}: {}", location, payload);
        eprintln!("Stack Trace:\n{}", backtrace);
        
        // 4. (Optional) Write to specific location to notify external monitoring
        // write_tombstone_file();

        // 5. Absolute barrier: Actively call abort() to terminate process, abandon Unwind.
        // This avoids executing Drop logic of other objects, preventing cascade destruction in dirty state.
        std::process::abort();
    }));
}
```

#### 3. Enable Core Dump for Post-Mortem Analysis

**Rule**: For crashes involving heavy FFI calls, `unsafe` memory operations, or extremely sporadic occurrences (once every few months), call stacks alone are insufficient. You need the entire memory snapshot at that moment.

**Implementation**: In application Dockerfile or Systemd configuration, must set `ulimit -c unlimited`. Cooperating with Linux system's `core_pattern`, when `std::process::abort()` is called, OS automatically dumps memory layout to file. Later, use `gdb` or `lldb` to load this "corpse" and Rust binary, directly examining actual values of all variables in memory at crash moment.
